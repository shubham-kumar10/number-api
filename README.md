## Numbers API

A simple wrapper around existing numbers [Numbers API](http://numbersapi.com/). As the original API is uses HTTP protocol, you will run into Same-origin policy errors while calling the API from your projects hosted on Github/your domain which has HTTPS enabled. You can avoid such errors by using this API instead.
